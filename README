Rafa Arce suggested plotting intensity vs time for recent earthquakes.

USGS has an API:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

Here's a query:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&latitude=17.949&longitude=-66.851&maxradiuskm=50

for a 50 km radius around Guanica.

The features have a "mag" and a "time".

USGS turned off the CORS flag for my old query. The API page recommends
automated applications to use the geojson feeds.

The full feed for 30 days is:

Need to find how to narrow the list to the specified area. properties.place contains "Puerto Rico".
